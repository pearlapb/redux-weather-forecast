# Weather Forecast Search

Currently learning Readux with this [course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) by Stephen Grinder. Used his [ReduxSimpleStarter](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter) to set up the app.

This is the third basic app built with this course. We go more in depth with redux and learn how to deal with redux when our state changes significantly over time.

### Getting Started

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
